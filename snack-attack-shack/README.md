## About the Challenge

As part of the Data Analytics Module of Masterschool's [Orientation Course](https://de.masterschool.com/en/domains/orientation-course/), we received a data analysis challenge to create a Data Analysis Report. Deliverables are:

- Analysis and visualizations in Google Sheets
- Written report of answering key questions in Google Docs

We are encouraged to use AI as much as possible to guide the analysis and interpretation. The report should answer these 7 key questions, as well as an additional 3 of our own:

- **80/20 Analysis**: Which 20% of products, customers, or categories generate 80% of revenue?  It doesnâ€™t have to be exactly 20 and 80, but are there some products, customers and categories significantly more important than others?
- **Product Lifecycle**: How many products have been discontinued, and when was the last order for each? What patterns do you notice?
- **Time Series Completeness**: Does the dataset include only full years and months? If not, how should we adjust our time-based revenue analysis?
- **Regional Performance**: Which countries or cities contribute most to revenue and profit? Is there untapped potential in specific regions?
- **Customer Loyalty**: What percentage of revenue comes from repeat vs. new customers? How does order frequency correlate with customer value?
- **Inventory Management**: Which products are at risk of stockouts? Which have excess inventory relative to their sales velocity?
- **Price Point Analysis**: How do different price points perform across categories? Is there an optimal price range for maximum profit?

With the assistance of AI-powered tools, which provided suggestions based on best practices in data analysis and relevance to executive decision-making, I added the following 3 questions:

- **Profitability Trends**: How have profit margins and profits evolved over time? What factors are driving changes in profitability, and are there any areas of concern to address?
- **Demand Forecasting**: What is the projected demand for the next quarter/year, and how can inventory be optimized and production planned to meet this demand effectively? What are the potential risks and opportunities associated with these forecasts?
- **Shipping Carrier Performance**: Which shipping carrier is the fastest on average? Which is the most cost-effective?

## The Data

The dataset consists of three interconnected tables:

- Products
- Orders
- Customers

The dataset can be viewed in Google Sheets: [Snack Attack Shack Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17sne5-vAbKo69kr0YPQMmApfRUFgpff48aJP6NSLnRY/edit?usp=drive_link)
