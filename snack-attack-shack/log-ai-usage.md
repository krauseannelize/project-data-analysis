  - Identified an efficient workflow to answer key questions comprehensively.

## 2025-04-17 - Company Logo Creation

- **Purpose**: Create a visually appealing company logo for use in project documentation.
- **AI Tool Used**: Canva's AI Image Generator Magic Media
- **Prompt**: "Generate a logo on a white background for 'Snack Attack Shack' using the colors blue, green and red."
- **Outcome**:
  - Chose one of the generated designs and note the color codes used for branding.
  - Incorporated the logo into project documentation for cohesive visual identity.

## 2025-04-18 - Heat Map Visualization

- **Purpose**: Create a visually accessible and appealing heatmap to visualize country performance data in the report.
- **AI Tool Used:** Microsoft Copilot
- **Prompt**: "Recommend a color-blind-friendly gradient using three colors (low, mid, high) for a heatmap."
- **Outcome**:
  - Selected gradient colors: Pale Gold (#FFE699), Orange (#FFA500), and Royal Blue (#002FA7) for low, mid, and high values, respectively.
  - Applied the gradient to the heatmap, ensuring accessibility and professional aesthetics.
  - Incorporated the heatmap into the report for impactful visualization of country performance.

## 2025-04-18 - Brainstorming and Debugging Customer Classification Logic

- **Purpose**: Collaboratively refine customer classification logic with AI to improve accuracy and address edge cases in the dataset.
- **AI Tool Used**: Microsoft Copilot
- **Approach**: Engaged in iterative troubleshooting and brainstorming with AI, testing classification formulas and identifying key refinements to address gaps, frequent orders, and dormant customer detection.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - Refined the formula for the "sinceLastOrder" column (Step 45) to calculate gaps between orders and enable precise customer analysis.
  - Adjusted the logic for the "customerStatus" column (Step 46), ensuring classifications dynamically capture behavior across "New," "Non-Returning," "Dormant," and "Regular".
    - "Dormant" customers were defined with stricter criteria, requiring both no recent activity within 6 months and a long gap (>365 days) between orders.
    - Reactivated customers (e.g., those with frequent recent orders after a long gap) are now correctly classified as "Regular."
   - Successfully debugged edge cases and misclassifications through detailed formula testing.

## 2025-04-19 - Refining and Expanding Customer Classification Logic

- **Purpose**: Collaboratively refine customer classification logic with AI to enhance accuracy, broaden classifications, and address edge cases in the dataset.
- **AI Tool Used: Microsoft Copilot
- **Approach**: Engaged in dynamic brainstorming and troubleshooting with AI to test new scenarios, adjust timeframes, and implement refined formulas for identifying New, Non-Returning, Dormant, and Regular customers.
- **Key Outcomes**:
  - Updated classification criteria for "New" customers:
    - Now based on the first order date, with a window of 120 days preceding the end date (30 April 2024), regardless of total order count.
    - Highlighted 1 customer as "New" due to an order placed 91 days ago.
  - Broadened the definition of "Non-Returning" customers:
    - Increased orderCount threshold to up to 2 orders, expanding the pool of inactive customers for analysis.
  - Refined criteria for "Dormant" and "Regular" customers:
    - Adjusted "multiple orders" to require at least 3 orders for more precise classifications.
  - Successfully debugged edge cases and recalibrated logic to align with updated customer behavior insights.
