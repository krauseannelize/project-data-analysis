I created a comprehensive sales performance report for AdventureWorks, analyzing key metrics and trends from July to December 2017. Using Excel, I built an interactive dashboard to visualize critical insights, including:

- **Overall Sales Performance:** Total revenue of $3.86M, with a 40% profit margin.
- **Sales Trends:** July was the peak sales month, driven by summer demand in the Northern Hemisphere.
- **Geographic Insights:** Australia outperformed larger markets like the U.S., highlighting its strong market potential.
- **Product Performance:** Road bikes dominated sales, with the top 5 models outselling mountain bikes by over 100 units each.
- **Delivery Performance:** Consistent delivery times across regions, with minor delays in France worth further investigation.

This project allowed me to sharpen my skills in data analysis and data visualization, while also challenging me to create a cohesive brand identity for AdventureWorks. I put together a complete package, including a branded dashboard and a detailed, professionally designed report that translates raw data into actionable business insights.
